# Machine Learning And Artificial Intelligence In Java

Machine learning (ML) is a field of inquiry devoted to understanding and building methods that 'learn', that is, methods
that leverage data to improve performance on some set of tasks.

Machine learning algorithms build a model based on sample data, known as training data, in order to make predictions or
decisions without being explicitly programmed to do so.

Machine learning algorithms are used in a wide variety of applications, such as in medicine, email filtering, speech
recognition, agriculture, and computer vision, where it is difficult or unfeasible to develop conventional algorithms to
perform the needed tasks.

Artificial intelligence (AI) is intelligence—perceiving, synthesizing, and inferring information—demonstrated by
machines, as opposed to intelligence displayed by non-human animals and humans. Example tasks in which this is done
include speech recognition, computer vision, translation between (natural) languages, as well as other mappings of
inputs.

AI applications include advanced web search engines (e.g., Google Search), recommendation systems (used by YouTube,
Amazon and Netflix), understanding human speech (such as Siri and Alexa), self-driving cars (e.g., Waymo), automated
decision-making and competing at the highest level in strategic game systems (such as chess and Go).
